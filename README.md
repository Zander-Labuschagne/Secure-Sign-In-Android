# Secure Sign In Android v2 *Discontinued*
This is a mobile application I have created in an attempt to improve my online account security, it is the Android version(_v2_) of my Secure Sign In project. Find the latest version at https://gitlab.com/Zander-Labuschagne/SecureSignIn-Mobile which should have more Android device support as well as support for other devices such as Sailfish OS and iOS. The user provides a password with an accompanying key that is unique to the website(or account) requiring the password, the application then provides a lengthy and complicated password to be used instead.

#### Compatibility notes:
  - _Android 7.1.1 or later is required to use this application._
  - _This application was so far only tested on a Sony Xperia X Compact running Android 8.0.0._

#### Benifits:
  - Remember one password for all sites, but all sites have different passwords.
  - Don't know the actual password which is entered in the password box on the website.
  - Provides a very strong, long and complex password.
  - No passwords are stored in file or database.
  - Easy to use.

This is my first Android application I have created. Feel free to criticize or comment.
There are desktop applications available as well, however some are not always up to date and I have left some of them discontinued/incomplete. I work on these projects in my free time only so don't expect regular updates from me.

Desktop version: https://gitlab.com/Zander-Labuschagne/SecureSignIn-v4b
  
The logo and name on the application comes from an iWorks template, it is not a registered company name or logo, I just added it to make it look impressive.

#### Installation:
Copy the _.apk_ Android binary file found inside the bin folder to you Android smartphone/tablet device using a USB cable.

#### How to use application:
  1. Enter a password you will remember in the password box, preferably a strong and complicated password because this will influence the complexity of the resulting password.
  2. Enter a key, such as google, facebook or whatever.
  3. Click on Encrypt Password and the rest is self explanatory. The password is cleared from memory after 10 seconds when copying the password.
